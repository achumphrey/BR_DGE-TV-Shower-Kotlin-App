# BR_DGE-TV-Shower-Kotlin-App
The project is a TV shower app written in Kotlin.
The API allows you to search a TV show based on given name.
The server returns one show for a single search endpoint.
We used Retrofit library to manage the client/server communication.
RxJava for managing asynchronuos operations.
MVVM design architecture was used with a repository for accessing network data.
Finally we wrote a unit test for the app.
